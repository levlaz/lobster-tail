# ü¶û Lobster Tail

A simple bash script that scrapes [Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs) and opens all the front page stories in your default browser.

## Features

- ü¶û Scrapes the Lobste.rs front page for story links
- üåê Opens all stories in your default browser with one command
- üñ•Ô∏è Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- üìä Shows you exactly which stories will be opened before proceeding
- ‚ö° Built-in rate limiting to avoid overwhelming your browser

## Usage

1. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x lobster_opener.sh
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./lobster_opener.sh
   ```

3. The script will:
   - Fetch the current stories from Lobste.rs
   - Display a numbered list of all stories found
   - Ask for confirmation before opening them
   - Open each story in your default browser with a small delay

## Example Output

```
ü¶û Lobste.rs Story Opener (Bash Version)
========================================
Fetching stories from lobste.rs...
Found 25 stories!

Stories to open:
1. https://example.com/story1
2. https://example.com/story2
...

Open all 25 stories in your browser? (y/N): y

Opening stories...
Opening 1/25: https://example.com/story1
Opening 2/25: https://example.com/story2
...

‚úÖ Successfully opened 25/25 stories!
```

## Requirements

- `curl` - for fetching web pages
- `grep` - for text processing
- `sed` - for text manipulation
- A system command to open URLs:
  - macOS: `open` (built-in)
  - Linux: `xdg-open` (usually pre-installed)
  - Windows: `start` (built-in)

## Platform Support

- ‚úÖ **macOS**: Uses the `open` command
- ‚úÖ **Linux**: Uses `xdg-open` command
- ‚úÖ **Windows**: Uses `start` command
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Other systems**: Will display URLs for manual copying

## How It Works

1. **Fetches HTML**: Downloads the Lobste.rs front page using `curl`
2. **Extracts URLs**: Uses `grep` and `sed` to find all story links with `class="u-url"`
3. **Processes URLs**: Converts relative URLs to absolute URLs
4. **User Confirmation**: Shows all stories and asks for permission
5. **Opens Stories**: Uses the appropriate system command to open each URL
